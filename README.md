# Design Improvement Project

## Task

Pick a piece of existing design (such as a [Morning Announcements](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x-mqD_2JWQJQyo00htRrQIDKbsNAxmn8EzV-dGGAUm0/edit?slide=id.g228d81432e6_1_245#slide=id.g228d81432e6_1_245) slide or a mediocre website for e.g. a local pizza place that you believe you can improve using your newfound design skills.

Download an _image_ of that design (screenshot, snipping tool, etc) and include it in your project folder under `images/original-design.png`.

Then, create a new design that improves upon the original using HTML, CSS, and possibly additional images you upload.

## How to Improve the Design

Some things to focus on:

CRAG:

- **Contrast**: Make sure there is enough contrast between text and background colors. Make sure you have elements that stand out and that there is a clear **visual hierarchy**.

- **Repetition**: Use consistent fonts, colors, and styles throughout your design to create a cohesive look.

- **Alignment**: Ensure that elements are properly aligned to create a clean and organized appearance.

- **Proximity**: Group related items together to create a clear structure and make it easier for users to find information.

Other tips:

_Typography_: Choose fonts with an eye both to visual appeal _and_ readability. Make sure that any large blocks of text are rendered in an easy-to-read font at a comfortable size.

_Color Scheme_: Select a color palette that complements the content and enhances the overall aesthetic. Use tools like [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) or [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create) to help you choose harmonious colors.

_Color Matching_: Use tools like the eye dropper to help you match colors from images in your backgrounds and text for an intentional "color pop" effect.

## Technical Note

I have set up some JavaScript, CSS and JavaScript in order to nicely show two designs side-by-side for comparison.

The intention is that you edit the parts of the `index.html` file that are marked with `<!-- YOUR CODE HERE -->` or `Edit` comments to add your new design.
For my JavaScript etc. to work, you need to leave the other parts of the code alone :)

Your code should go entirely in:

- index.html
- styles.css
- images/ (any images you want to add)

You shouldn't have to edit

- assignment-code.js (handles the buttons, etc.)
- assignment.css (unless you want to change colors and fonts, which you can do)

## A Note on AI

**Important:** While Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT or Claude.ai can be useful for tasks like this, their results often lack creativity and feel lifeless. **DO NOT** use AI to generate entire webpages for this assignment — this is considered cheating.

However, you **may** use AI to assist with individual elements, but you must credit it wherever applicable. Be sure to cite AI use.

## Required Components

### Elements:

- You have uploaded an ORIGINAL design image and included it in your page.
- You identify specific flaws in the design you are looking to remedy.
- You have created a NEW design that improves upon the original.
- Your new design includes at least:
  - A heading (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc)
  - At least one image
  - At least two pieces of text.

Note: if the original design doesn't include at least 3 elements, it is not complex enough for the project.

## Rubric

### Required Elements Included

[3 - Proficient]

- You have successfully linked an original element.
- You have successfully reproduced the elements of the original design in HTML.

[4 - Mastery]

- You have used correct semantic HTML elements for all parts of the design (i.e. headings, paragraphs, lists used appropriately).

### Design Principles

[3 - Proficient]

- You identify flaws in the original design using design principles.
- Your new design improves upon the original using design principles.

[4 - Mastery]

- You effectively apply multiple design principles (CRAG, typography, color scheme, etc) to create a visually appealing and functional design.
- Your new design makes thoughtful use of design principles.

### Color and Typography

[3 - Proficient]

- Your new design uses a cohesive color scheme that enhances the overall aesthetic.
- Your new design uses typography that is both visually appealing and readable.

[4 - Mastery]

- You make highly effective use of color, coordinating colors of backgrounds,text and images to create a harmonious and engaging design.
- You pay exquisite attention to typography, including tweaking not just fonts, but line-height, letter-spacing, and other properties to create a polished and professional look.
